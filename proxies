# Sample proxy list for slimrat
#
# Should reside in ~/.slimrat/proxies when relying on automatic loading.

# The full proxy specification consists out of two parts:
#   - the URI
#   - the protocol specification
http://a.b.c.d:1234	http,ftp

# When the protocols are omitted, by default the "http" protocol is used
http://a.b.c.d:1234

# Similarly, when not specifying the type of proxy in the URI, slimrat
# will use it as an HTTP proxy
a.b.c.d:1234	http,ftp

# SOCKS is supported too (in combination with e.g. TOR), but needs
# the cpan module LWP::Protocol::socks
socks://localhost:9050	http,https

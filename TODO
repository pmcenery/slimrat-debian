# GENERAL #
  - add links to running instance
    slimrat --add --list list.txt http://link/1 http://link/2
  - GUI: notifications Gtk2::Notify?
  - INTERFACES:
    * cli
    * gui
    * web
    * ncurses
    * jabber
  - Statusbar: does not seem to be threadsafe.
    Testcase: check group of links, then check a single one.
    threads->create call blocks when statusbar enabled (really...)
  - Download speed indication in GUI (blocker: statusbar)
  - Rework the filename fetching, as some download provides doesn't display
    the actual filename in the statuspage, but only upon final request.
    How to handle resuming then?
  - UTF-8 compatibility
  - Make plugin path configurable, support a substitution for $RealBin (~ ->
    home, x -> $RealBin)
    or eventual, instead of plugins, folder with all slimrat data (plugin.pm,
    toolbox.pm, etc)

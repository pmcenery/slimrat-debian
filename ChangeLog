2009-11-07 Tim Besard <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

   * plugins: finished resume handline.

   * common (download): added an extra retry check when resuming has been
     attempted (as some servers tend to fail upon Range requests, though
     they advertise the range capability).


2009-11-06 Tim Besard <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

   * common (download): altered the exception handling framework to a more
     advanced alternative, based on Try::Tiny.

   * plugins: moved the reference blessings to an earlier place, before any
     possibly die(), as that could prohibit the destructor from getting
     called and mess up resource handling.

   * common (download): speed calculation using a moving-average algorithm.


2009-11-05 Tim Besard <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

   * plugins: altered retry framework, known loops (e.g. no slots available)

     functionality (Plugin.pm:get_data)


2009-11-04 Tim Besard <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

   * configuration + others: correct usage of contains/defines, which now allows
     a flexible perl-alike syntax, emits appropriate warnings and is a lot less
     error prone.


2009-10-13 Tim Besard <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

2009-09-15 Tim Besard <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

   * configuration (get): warn upon undefined keys.

   * common (download): fix wait timer.

     traces.

   * common (download): added code which traces the callstack
     withing the inner evaluation block.

   * all: avoided Configuration::get() calls on potentially
     undefined values.


2009-09-13 Tim Besard <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

2009-09-02 Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * slimrat: upon request, configurable option in case
      of plugin failure (issue 69).

    * plugins: removed all loop-based code, get_data now
      just exists upon failure. It's up to the caller to
      support some retry-on-failure stuff.

    * common: adjusted some threading code, exporting a
      flag when an old threads library has been found
      ($THRCOMP).

    * plugin: added some auxilary functions to avoid code
      duplication within the plugins.


2009-09-01 Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * plugins: updated to make them work again.

    * plugins: implemented some code allowing a retry
      upon failure.

      a relative to an absolute setting.


2009-08-31 Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * common: all plugin activity now happens in eval context,
      which enables plugins to use die() instead of slimrat-
      specific error functionality, removes some duplicate code,
      and makes slimrat invulnerable for crashes within used
      packages (at the expense of a bit performance though).

    * plugin: replaced resource handling by non-busy blocking
      call, removing the need of slimrat & slimrat-cli to
      do anything about resource handling.


2009-08-30  Přemek Vyhnal  <premysl.vyhnal gmail com>

    * plugins: added CZshare - first plugin with PREMIUM account support

      with a per-thread object).


2009-08-24 Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * common (download): multithreaded rate control, with threads

    * Log (dump_*): added "extra information" parameter, and
      added default value "html" to "type" parameter.


2009-07-19  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * plugins: Uploading.com plugin, fixed issue 39.

    * slimrat: split into Common.cm code.

    * log: several simplifications.


2009-07-17  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * mediafire: fixed issue 44 - MediaFire plugin


2009-07-16  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * plugin (new): abandoned eval structure, using dynamic
      binding (fixes issue 32).

    * Direct: should be manually enabled now.

    * configuration (init): parent object gets appropriately altered
      upon initialisation of a configuration entry in a
      subsection.

    * log: support for log and screen output, and some basic
      possibilities to configure the verbosity and type of
      output to both of them.

    * configuration (file_read): substitute negatively connoted
      values by a 0.

    * plugins: cleaner plugin configuration, passed through
      construction to make certain checks possible as early as

    * configuration: simplified it a bit, removing multiple values
      per key and some other fancy stuff.


2009-07-15  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * configuration (file_read, section, merge): implemented
      support for sections (indicated by "[\w+]"), extracting
      them from the main configuration object, and merging them
      back in an object with default values (see documentation).

    * configuration: removed any dependancy to other custom
      packages, making it usable all over the place.

    * toolbox, plugins: moved dwait() to log, to remove the

      download summary) to the Log.pm module.

    * slimrat: removed the wget dependancy, using a pure-Perl
      solution now (LWP-based downloader). The plugin model has
      also altered a lot, with the possibility to support
      several protocols and enhanced requests.

    * plugins: ported to the new plugin framework, implementing
      additional get_filename and get_size methods where
      possible.


2009-06-27  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * slimrat: initial switch to LWP, only porting the Direct
      plugin for now.


2009-06-19  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * slimrat-gui: refactored the code, and ported some parts
      to the configuration handler.

      documentation.

    * log (usage): added a new reporting function which
      indicates invalid usage.


2009-06-18  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * configuration: removed the revert() functionality, but
      added support for a key with multiple values.


2009-06-17  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * slimrat: implemented the use of the brand new configuration
      handler.

    * configuration (file_read): implemented configuration
      file parsing, with support for mutable as well as
      immutable entries.

    * configuration: fixed some bugs with the struct handling,
      and made use of the configuration handler on some places
      in the main slimrat executable.


2009-06-16  Přemek Vyhnal  <premysl.vyhnal gmail com>

    * plugins: added UploadedTo.


2009-06-16  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * Toolbox (dwait): fixed reference to ptime().

    * slimrat: added function prototypes, and enhanced the command-
      line options handline.

    * slimrat: enhanced backgrounding support, through a state file
      to save the PID of the daemon in, and a killswitch to kill a
      single running instance.

    * Config: added the initial functions for a class which will ease
      the handling of configurations, originating from different sources
      across the system.


2009-06-09  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * slimrat: use a hash in combinaton with GetOptions instead
      of several global variables.

    * queue: added POD documentation.

    * log: added POD documentation, and replaced some more raw prints
      with routines from log package.


2009-06-04  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * log: added controllable verbosity level, through --verbose
      and --quiet parameters.

    * queue: converted the datastructure so it properly
      supports a get() call to get the current URL, and
      an advance() call to proceed to the next URL (which
      possibly reads from a file, skipping commented out or
      already processed links). Fixes issue 30.
      This makes a $status=0 (from the check() function each
      plugin should implement) value relevant: it indicates
      a temporary failure, so the link doesn't get commented
      out but ignored so it can get retried upon a new session.

    * ChangeLog: added a requested changelog with most prominent
    changes. To be kept up to date from now on.


2009-05-20  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * log: introduced a helper library to ease logging. It
      provides several functions (debug, info, warning, error,
      fatal) to differentiate the message. The message is
      coloured depending to the message level, but verbosity
      settings have yet to be implemented.

    * plugins: added OdSiebie and HotFile plugins.

    * all: relicensed to MIT-license.


2009-05-19  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * plugins: added Data.hu plugin.

    * slimrat: added custom commands to execute pre-download, and
      upon failure or completion.


2009-05-17  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * slimrat: added backgrounding capabilities.

    * plugins/Rapidshare: added interval-check.

    * slimrat: support for comments in the link file.

    * slimrat: downloaded links get comments out upon completion.

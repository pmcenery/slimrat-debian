Release notes
-------------

1) Downloading to Unicode folders

When using the GUI to download files, slimrat _will_ have difficulties doing so
when your destination folder contains non-ASCII characters. Your filesystem
might support them, but decoding the UTF8 string returned by the FileChooser
widget isn't done properly yet. This will be fixed in the first bugfix release.


2) Download resuming

Though implemented and tested basically, users have reported resuming to be
non-functional in combination with most plugins.


3) Threading issues

Slimrat now makes extensive use of threads, which seems to be error-prone,
especially on older Perl releases and when closing slimrat down. If you happen
to find reproducible cases though, please report them to our bug tracker!


4) Proxy failure

Failing proxies are _not_ detected, so when a proxy is down all URLs will
consequently get marked as DEAD. This will get fixed (or worked around) as soon
as a proper way to check whether the proxy is still alive is found.



Installation
------------

See the INSTALL file for a detailed guide on how to install
slimrat.

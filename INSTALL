Dependancies
------------

The installation instructions below only document the installation of
slimrat itself, you might need to install optional dependancies.

Those dependancies could be configured by the package manager, or
you might need to install them yourself, especially when manually
installing slimrat.

You need to install the following dependancies using your package manager of choice:

Main
  - Perl (at least 5.8, 5.10 recommended)
  - Getopt::Long
  - LWP::UserAgent
  - Term::ANSIColor
  - WWW::Mechanize

Automatic captcha solving:
  - tesseract
  - imagemagick

Command-line captcha viewing
  - aview/asciiview (or other, this is a configurable setting)

GUI
  - Gtk2::GladeXML
  - Gtk2::SimpleList
  - xclip (optional, handles GUI clipboard extensions)
  - Spiffy (optional, handles GUI clipboard extensions)

Some examples using package managers:

a) On Debian/Ubuntu
      aptitude install libwww-mechanize-perl
      aptitude install libgtk2-gladexml-perl xclip libspiffy-perl # For the GUI
      aptitude install aview # For command-line captcha viewing
      aptitude install imagemagick tesseract # For automatic captcha solving
      
b) On FreeBSD
      portinstall -Pp devel/p5-Getopt-Long devel/p5-Term-ANSIColor x11-toolkits/p5-Gtk2 x11-toolkits/p5-Gtk2-GladeXML x11-toolkits/p5-Gtk2-Ex-Simple-List www/p5-LWP-UserAgent-Determined www/p5-WWW-Mechanize
      
c) Manually (through CPAN)
      perl -MCPAN -e 'install Getopt::Long, LWP::UserAgent, Term::ANSIColor, WWW::Mechanize';
      perl -MCPAN -e 'install Gtk2::GladeXML, Gtk2::SimpleList, Spiffy';



Arch Linux
----------

You can install Slimrat from AUR:
  - stable version: http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=20499
  - SVN version: http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=29697



Gentoo
------

1) Install layman and autounmask

Run the following commands if you haven't installed them already:
   emerge layman autounmask


2) Add the "kde-testing" overlay

Run the following command to add the "kde-testing" overlay, in which
slimrat resides:
   layman -a kde-testing

NOTE: for more information about overlays, have a look at the Gentoo
      documentation (http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/overlays/userguide.xml)


3) Install slimrat

a) Stable version:
   autounmask net-misc/slimrat-0.9.55
   emerge slimrat

b) SVN version:
   autounmast net-misc/slimrat-9999
   emerge slimrat



PLD linux
---------

Currently no prebuilt RPM package is available, but the projects
CVS repository contains a SPEC file to generate one.

1) Initialise the folder structure

Do this by issuing the command
   builder --init-rpm-dir

After that, enter the "rpm" directory at your home folder.


2) Download the spec file from the CVS repository into "~/rpm/SPECS"

You can find the spec file at the following url:
    http://cvs.pld-linux.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/packages/slimrat/

Currently the spec file does not require any other files from the
CVS repository, but this could change with time. You might need to
check out more files from that location.


3) Build the RMP

Execute the next command to build a binary RPM:
   ./builder -bb -bc -R foo


4) Install the resulting RPM



Other RPM-based distro's
------------------

RPMs (though currently outdated) are available at:
   http://rpm.pbone.net/index.php3?stat=3&search=slimrat&srodzaj=3



Manual installation
-------------------

Unpack the tarball at a place you want to. Users wanting to run slimrat do not
need to have write access to that folder.
   tar -xjvf slimrat-x.x.x.tar.bz2 -C /usr/local/bin/

Create symlinks to the main slimrat executables.
   ln -s /Path/to/SlimRat/slimrat /usr/local/bin/slimrat
   ln -s /Path/to/SlimRat/slimrat-gui /usr/local/bin/slimrat-gui

Optional: create a system-wide configuration file at /etc/slimrat.conf, a sample
          configuration file documenting all options is provided under the name "slimrat.conf"



Windows
-------

NOTE: slimrat has not been tested for use at non-Unix based operation
      system, so many features (including the GUI) might not work. If you
      come across issues, we'd be happy to fix them so please fill apropriate
      bug reports.

Unpack the tarball at a place you want to, you can use Winrar to open the archive.
You will need to install the dependancies usign CPAN, or if available using the
package manager of the Perl distribution you are using (ie. "PPM" when using 
ActiveState Perl).

NOTE: configuration files are currently also unavailable on Windows, so you'll need to
      specify any options through the command-line.

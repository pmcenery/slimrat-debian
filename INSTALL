Dependencies
------------

The installation instructions below only document the installation of
slimrat itself, you might need to install optional dependencies.

Those dependencies could be configured by the package manager, or
you might need to install them yourself, especially when manually
installing slimrat.

You need to install the following dependencies using your package manager of choice:

Main
  - Perl (at least 5.8, 5.10 recommended)
  - Getopt::Long
  - LWP::UserAgent
  - Term::ANSIColor
  - WWW::Mechanize

Automatic captcha solving:
  - tesseract
  - imagemagick

Command-line captcha viewing
  - aview/asciiview (or other, this is a configurable setting)

GUI
  - Gtk2::GladeXML
  - Gtk2::SimpleList

Some plugins needs extra perl modules. Install them from your package manager or via CPAN. 
You don't need them installed if you dont want to use that plugins.
  - URI::Escape
  - WWW::Mechanize 1.52 (newer version)
  - JSON::PP

Some examples using package managers:

a) On Debian/Ubuntu
      aptitude install libwww-mechanize-perl
      aptitude install libgtk2-gladexml-perl # For the GUI
      aptitude install aview # For command-line captcha viewing
      aptitude install imagemagick tesseract # For automatic captcha solving

NOTE: when using Debian Lenny (the current stable), some plugins won't work due
      to libwww-mechanize-perl not being up to date enough. You can install a
      newer version using CPAN:
          su -
          cpan
          # If you haven't run cpan before, you'll need to configure a bunch of
          #   settings. You can let CPAN configure them automatically for you.
          # The next two commands are optional, in order to ensure you are
          #   running the most recent CPAN module.
          upgrade CPAN
          reload CPAN
          # The next command installs the newer library. It'll need a bunch of
          #   dependencies, just install them along. Some dependencies are
          #   optional, which you can skip (some test modules, CPAN will tell
          #   you).
          install WWW::Mechanize
          # If you got an error "could not find unzip", use the following two
          #   commands.
          o conf unzip unzip
          o conf commit
      Now Perl should prefer the newer installed libraries, which'll make
      slimrat capable of using the previously failing plugins.

b) On FreeBSD
      portinstall -Pp devel/p5-Getopt-Long devel/p5-Term-ANSIColor x11-toolkits/p5-Gtk2 x11-toolkits/p5-Gtk2-GladeXML x11-toolkits/p5-Gtk2-Ex-Simple-List www/p5-LWP-UserAgent-Determined www/p5-WWW-Mechanize
      
c) Manually (through CPAN)
      perl -MCPAN -e 'install Getopt::Long, LWP::UserAgent, Term::ANSIColor, WWW::Mechanize';
      perl -MCPAN -e 'install Gtk2::GladeXML, Gtk2::SimpleList';



Arch Linux
----------

You can install Slimrat from AUR:
  - stable version: http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=20499
  - SVN version: http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=29697



Gentoo
------

1) Install autounmask

Run the following commands if you haven't installed them already:
   emerge autounmask


2) Install slimrat

a) Stable version:
   autounmask net-misc/slimrat-1.0
   emerge slimrat

b) SVN version:
   autounmast net-misc/slimrat-9999
   emerge slimrat



PLD linux
---------

Currently no prebuilt RPM package is available, but the project's
CVS repository contains a SPEC file to generate one.

1) Initialize the folder structure

Do this by issuing the command
   builder --init-rpm-dir

After that, enter the "rpm" directory at your home folder.


2) Download the spec file from the CVS repository into "~/rpm/SPECS"

You can find the spec file at the following url:
    http://cvs.pld-linux.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/packages/slimrat/

Currently the spec file does not require any other files from the
CVS repository, but this could change with time. You might need to
check out more files from that location.


3) Build the RMP

Execute the next command to build a binary RPM:
   ./builder -bb -bc -R foo


4) Install the resulting RPM



Other RPM-based distro's
------------------

RPMs (though currently outdated) are available at:
   http://rpm.pbone.net/index.php3?stat=3&search=slimrat&srodzaj=3



Manual installation
-------------------

Unpack the tarball at a place you want to. Users wanting to run slimrat do not
need to have write access to that folder.
   tar -xjvf slimrat-x.x.x.tar.bz2 -C /usr/local/bin/

Create symlinks to the main slimrat executables.
   ln -s /Path/to/SlimRat/slimrat /usr/local/bin/slimrat
   ln -s /Path/to/SlimRat/slimrat-gui /usr/local/bin/slimrat-gui

Optional: create a system-wide configuration file at /etc/slimrat.conf, a sample
          configuration file documenting all options is provided under the name "slimrat.conf"



Windows
-------

NOTE: slimrat has not been tested for use at non-Unix based operation
      system, so many features (including the GUI) might not work. If you
      come across issues, we'd be happy to fix them so please fill appropriate
      bug reports.

Unpack the tarball at a place you want to, you can use Winrar to open the archive.
You will need to install the dependencies usign CPAN, or if available using the
package manager of the Perl distribution you are using (ie. "PPM" when using 
ActiveState Perl).

NOTE: configuration files are currently also unavailable on Windows, so you'll need to
      specify any options through the command-line.
